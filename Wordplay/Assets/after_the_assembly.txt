The first time I spoke to your Mother

It's after the assembly.
She passes me.
She's so close.
I love you - I'm too afraid to speak.
To my tribe I am a man.
I killed/tamed/fought the lion!
She is more daunting.

Father cannot understand.
He had Mary at my age.
I am timid like Mother.
If only I could rescue her...
I could show her how I feel.
But life's not that simple.
Society has rules.
I will woo with words or not at all.
Maybe it's not so bad.
Love is like a game.
I can't change the rules.
I must learn to be a better player.
I must learn new tricks.

I watch myself walk to her.
Without my consent I bare my heart.
